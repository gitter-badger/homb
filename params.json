{"name":"Homb","tagline":"Home for Bash (.homb) - Isolate application specific bash settings.","body":"Homb\r\n====\r\n\r\n# Welcome Homb \r\n\r\nThe Homb project is set of shell extensions for console applications. It is \r\nintended for use with <a href=\"http://freshshell.com/\">fresh</a> for managing \r\napplication configurations. \r\n\r\nCurrently we have only tested with newer versions of bash on CentOS/Redhat.\r\n\r\n## Install Homb\r\n\r\nHomb works only with newer versions of bash and also needs git. \r\n\r\n### Just Homb\r\n\r\nFor this example we install Homb into the ~/.homb directory. Here is how to \r\nclone .homb into your \"${HOME}\" or \"~\" directory.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/threeiem/homb ~/.homb\r\n```\r\nNow add this line to your ~/.bash_profile file. <b>Do NOT add this line to the\r\n~/.bashrc file!</b> The .homb project is intended for interactive shells only.\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport HOMBASE=\"${HOME}/.homb\"\r\nsource $HOMBASE/rc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Homb with Fresh\r\n\r\nThe Homb project works with <a href=\"http://freshshell.com/\">fresh</a> to handle\r\nthe application configuration files. Fresh is the right hand for .homb and \r\nfunctions poorly without <a href=\"http://freshshell.com/\">fresh</a>.\r\n\r\n### Install fresh\r\n\r\nInstall  <a href=\"http://freshshell.com/\">fresh</a> with the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbash -c \"`curl -sL get.freshshell.com`\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Configure Bash (~/.bash_profile)\r\n\r\nOnce  <a href=\"http://freshshell.com/\">fresh</a> is downloaded add this to your\r\n~/.bash_profile file (not ~/.bashrc).\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Set $HOMBASE before source of Fresh's shell.sh\r\nexport HOMBASE=\"${HOME}/.homb\"\r\nfpath=\"${HOME}/.fresh/build/shell.sh\" && test -f $fpath && source $fpath\r\n\r\n```\r\n### Configure (~/.freshrc)\r\n\r\nAdd this to the .freshrc file. The location of this file can be configured so we\r\nare using ~/.freshrc in the home directory.\r\n\r\n## Common Problems\r\n\r\n* <b>Not using bash!</b> Homb is for <b><u>bash only</u></b>. Sorry, maybe another time.\r\n\r\n* <b>Non-Interactive Bash</b> Check to see if you are running an interative shell. Check with this command...\r\n\r\n```\r\nshopt login_shell\r\n```\r\n\r\n* <b>Graphical Does Not Mean Interactive</b> Some terminal programs like konsole do not start bash interactively. For konsole you will need to modify the profile. Here is the command to run bash interactively.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbash -l\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
