{"name":"Homb","tagline":"Application extentions for bash shell.","body":"Homb\r\n====\r\n\r\n# Welcome Homb \r\n\r\nThe Homb project is set of bash extensions for applications. It is intended \r\nfor use with <a href=\"http://freshshell.com/\">fresh</a> for managing application\r\nconfigurations including Homb itself. \r\n\r\nHomb only works with newer versions of bash and also relies on git. Homb can be\r\ninstalled solo to extend individual applications. Currently we have only tested\r\nwith newer versions of bash on CentOS/Redhat and flavors of Ubuntu.\r\n\r\n# Homb Alone\r\n\r\nFor this example we install Homb into the ~/.homb directory. Here is how to \r\nclone .homb into your \"${HOME}\" or \"~\" directory.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/threeiem/homb ~/.homb\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow add this line to your ~/.bash_profile file. <b>DO NOT ADD THIS LINE TO THE\r\n~/.bashrc FILE!</b> The .homb project is intended for interactive shells only.\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport HOMBASE=\"${HOME}/.homb\" && test -e $HOMBASE/rc && source $HOMBASE/rc\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Homb with Fresh\r\n\r\nThe Homb project works with <a href=\"http://freshshell.com/\">fresh</a> to handle\r\nthe application configuration files. Fresh is the right hand for .homb and \r\nfunctions poorly without <a href=\"http://freshshell.com/\">fresh</a>.\r\n\r\n## Install fresh\r\n\r\nInstall  <a href=\"http://freshshell.com/\">fresh</a> with the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbash -c \"`curl -sL get.freshshell.com`\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configure Bash (~/.bash_profile)\r\n\r\nOnce  <a href=\"http://freshshell.com/\">fresh</a> is downloaded add this to your\r\n~/.bash_profile file (not ~/.bashrc).\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Set $HOMBASE before source of Fresh's shell.sh\r\nexport HOMBASE=\"${HOME}/.homb\"\r\nfpath=\"${HOME}/.fresh/build/shell.sh\" && test -f $fpath && source $fpath\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configure (~/.freshrc)\r\n\r\nAdd this to the .freshrc file. The location of this file can be configured so we\r\nare using ~/.freshrc in the home directory.\r\n\r\n# Common Problems\r\n\r\n* <b>Not using bash!</b> Homb is for <b><u>bash only</u></b>. Sorry, maybe another time.\r\n\r\n* <b>Non-Interactive Bash</b> Check to see if you are running an interative shell. Check with this command...\r\n\r\n```\r\nshopt login_shell\r\n```\r\n\r\n* <b>Graphical Does Not Mean Interactive</b> Some terminal programs like konsole do not start bash interactively. For konsole you will need to modify the profile. Here is the command to run bash interactively.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbash -l\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
