It is intended \r\nfor use with <a href=\"http://freshshell.com/\">fresh</a> for managing application\r\nconfigurations, including Homb itself. Homb can be installed standalone or with\r\nfresh (recommended). Homb leaves all the application configurations to Fresh \r\nwhile Homb extends applications with various completions, helpers, and tools.\r\nSee the <a href=\"https://github.com/threeiem/homb/wiki\">wiki</a> for details on\r\nhow to use Homb.\r\n\r\nHomb only works with newer versions of bash and also relies on \r\n<a href=\"http://git-scm.com/\">git</a>. Currently we have tested Homb with newer\r\nversions of bash on CentOS/Redhat and flavors of Ubuntu.\r\n\r\n# Installing Homb with Fresh \r\n\r\nThe Homb project works best with Fresh. \r\n## Install fresh\r\n\r\nInstall  <a href=\"http://freshshell.com/\">fresh</a> with the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbash -c \"`curl -sL get.freshshell.com`\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configure Bash (~/.bash_profile)\r\n\r\nOnce  <a href=\"http://freshshell.com/\">fresh</a> is downloaded add this to your\r\n~/.bash_profile file (not ~/.bashrc).\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport HOMBASE=\"${HOME}/.homb\"\r\nexport FASHO=\"${HOME}/.fresh/build/shell.sh\" && test -f $FASHO && source $FASHO\r\n```\r\n## Configure (~/.freshrc)\r\n\r\nAdd this to the .freshrc file. In this example we are using \"~/.homb/\" as the \r\nsetting for the $HOMBASE environment variable in the .bash_profile file.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n# Homb: Makes setting $HOMBASE for Homb simply $HOME/.homb\r\n#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nfresh threeiem/homb . --file=~/.homb/\r\n\r\n# Homb resource file to load Homb\r\nfresh threeiem/homb rc\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Homb Alone\r\n\r\nThe Homb project used to work alone, but now it requires Fresh to be installed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Common Problems\r\n\r\n* <b>Not using bash!</b> Homb is for <b><u>bash only</u></b>. Sorry, maybe another time.\r\n\r\n* <b>Non-Interactive Bash</b> Check to see if you are running an interative shell. Check with this command...\r\n```\r\nshopt login_shell\r\n```\r\n\r\n* <b>Graphical Does Not Mean Interactive</b> Some terminal programs like konsole do not start bash interactively. For konsole you will need to modify the profile. Here is the command to run bash interactively.\r\n```\r\nbash -l\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
